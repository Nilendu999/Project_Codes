ABSTRACT:

The goal for this year is to implement inverse kinematics and make the bipedal robot to walk using
the gait generated from the inverse kinematics. At first, some hardware parts on the bot must be 
modified such that they are robust and withstand the load, and eliminate the slip present in the gears
. We need to fabricate PCBs for electrical circuit and attach end contact switches for safety. Once
the fabrication is completely done, we'll focus on moving the bot in forward kinematics to test the 
robustness of the design and make minor tweaks. After this is achieved we'll implement inverse kinematics
and tune the control of the bipedal robot.
