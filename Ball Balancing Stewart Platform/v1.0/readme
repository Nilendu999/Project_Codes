BALL BALANCING ROBOT


SUMMER PROJECT REPORT


STATUS: UNDER DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT BY: NILENDU GANGULI
 
ABSTRACT
Ball Balancing Robot (Project Stewart) focuses on implementation of the concepts of Stewart Platform.
The project consists of a plate controlled by actuators that results in motion in two directions. 
The controlled movement of the plate is used to move a ball placed on it in a pre-defined manner.
The position of the ball with respect to the plate is monitored using a camera above the centre of the plate.
The program that controls the actuators and processes the positional data is executed in a computer.
The computer takes input from the user and after making the necessary calculations guides the ball to the required
position or along the instructed path. There is an Arduino connected to the computer via the serial port. 
Serial communication is established between the program running in the computer and the arduino. 
The data transferred along the serial port is used the control the servos. Proper movement of the ball demands the 
working of all systems in coherence. Such coherent operation is achieved through development of efficient control 
algorithms and calibration of the same. The system gets feedback from two sensors that measures the tilt in each 
of the two directions and the camera that monitors the position of the ball. The feedback from camera is persistently 
used to calculate error. This error is the feedback to the control system. The feedback from the sensors reveal the
orientation of the platform and are used to reduce error in the actuator mechanism.
 
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
BASIC TASK 1:
Balancing a ball on a plank (1-Dimensional Balancing). Moving the ball to a desired point in one dimension.
Advanced task 1:
Balancing the ball on a plate. Moving the ball to a desired coordinate on the plate.
Advanced task 2:
Guiding the ball along a well-defined path e.g., circle, square, rectangle, ellipse.
